# AGENTS.md

This repository follows the PRDS standard from chimeranext/better-toolkits and requires PRs to be reviewable, scoped, and human-approved. The upstream `/toolkits-initial-setup` bootstrap command is the single source of truth for harness setup and local tooling wiring; do not drift into a repo-local fork of that protocol.

## Required PR behavior

- Use a conventional-commit style title for every PR subject:
  - `feat(scope): add capability`
  - `fix(scope): resolve regression`
  - `docs(pr): align repo to PRDS`
  - `chore(ci): update templates`
- Branch names must follow the pattern: `type/ticket-n-slug`
- Every PR must include the PRDS sections in the body:
  - Summary
  - Tracker
  - Test plan
  - Scope boundaries
  - Risk / rollout
  - Screenshots / evidence
- The PR description is part of the deliverable and must be written before the PR is marked ready for review.
- Keep each PR focused; do not bundle unrelated refactors or broad cleanup into the same change.
- Draft PRs are the default until a human explicitly approves the review.

## Required title format

`<type>(<scope>): <outcome> (TICKET-N)`

Examples:

- `docs(pr): add PRDS template and repo conventions (TICKET-PRDS-1)`
- `feat(runbooks): add AI-safe debloat launch guidance (TICKET-WS-42)`

## Required PR body template

```md
